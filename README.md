Open Todo's
* Handle case when there are no friends of a user
* Send back a random bitch when the related action is tapped from notification
* Invite by email
* Contacts sync
* Write a boot service which loads the jruby instance
* Handle errors in network calls
* Beautify UI - make it look like actual Yo!
* Add a splash screen while jruby loads
* Add an actionbar with a possible refresh button (which just re-inits the ui)



Closed Todo's
* Setup Toast to display userâ€™s name when he logs in - refactor into common/ui
* Setup toast when user sends a bitch
* Better config management - dev/production
* GCM registration
* Loader is not working/showing
* Whatsapp share
* Logcat complains too much is happening on main thread. Either explore AsyncTask or understand the usage of Thread.join
* Tapping on push notification - nothing happens
* Push notification UI is invoked from User model - that sucks. Can we somehow route it back to MainActivity?
* Handle install referer
