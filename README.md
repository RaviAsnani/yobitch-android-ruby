Open Todo's
* Write a boot service which loads the jruby instance  (Incomplete work in boot_completed branch. Crash when notification is received)
* Beautify UI - make it look like actual Yo!
* Add a splash screen while jruby loads
* Explore using https://github.com/nathankleyn/ruby_events for events
* Logcat STILL complains too much is happening on main thread.


Closed Todo's
* Setup Toast to display userâ€™s name when he logs in - refactor into common/ui
* Setup toast when user sends a bitch
* Better config management - dev/production
* GCM registration
* Loader is not working/showing
* Whatsapp share
* Logcat complains too much is happening on main thread. Either explore AsyncTask or understand the usage of Thread.join
* Tapping on push notification - nothing happens
* Push notification UI is invoked from User model - that sucks. Can we somehow route it back to MainActivity?
* Handle install referer
* Send back a random bitch when the related action is tapped from notification
* Package JRuby core with the apk
* Handle errors in network calls
* Handle case when there are no friends of a user => Is it even valid anymore with the Bot in place?
* Save user locally on device



Best if's
* Usage of friend should be moved to a separate Friend model (which does not exists yet)
* MessageList and FriendList models should be introduced
* Data exchange from notification received to activity opened via intent is very hacky as of now. Explore better options via either a Bundle or Intent.put_extra mechanism



Delayed till next versions
* Invite by email
* Contacts sync
