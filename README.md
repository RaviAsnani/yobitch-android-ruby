====================

Open Todo's

# Handle case when there are no users
# Setup Toast to display userâ€™s name when he logs in - refactor into common/ui
# Setup toast when user sends a bitch
# Invite by email
# Contacts sync
# Write a boot service which loads the jruby instance
# Push notification UI is invoked from User model - that sucks. Can we somehow route it back to MainActivity?
# Handle errors in network calls

Closed Todo's

# Better config management - dev/production
# GCM registration
# Loader is not working/showing
# Whatsapp share
# Logcat complains too much is happening on main thread. Either explore AsyncTask or understand the usage of Thread.join
# Tapping on push notification - nothing happens
